= FEATURES =

**Voucher codes management:**

The voucher codes used by your customers during their purchases are automatically detected and transmitted in the tracking via the argbr parameter. You can therefore use the [VoucherTAG](https://helpdesk-advertiser.kwanko.com/en/support/solutions/articles/101000383420-voucher-code) solution proposed by Kwanko to provide voucher codes dedicated to specific publishers of your choice.

**Partnertag management:**

You have the possibility to activate the Partnertag (Container Tag). By activating it, you will have access to a wider and more varied network of publishers and you will be able to boost your sales and your turnover.

If this is the case, the Kwanko extension may be incompatible with some of the extensions you use.
In this case we invite you to install the generic tracking.
